This web application is a learning platform that attempts to teach about
common web security flaws. It contains generic security flaws that apply to
most web applications. It also contains lessons that specifically pertain to
the .NET framework. The excercises in this app are intented to teach about web
security attacks and how developers can overcome them.

 - Google Chrome performs filtering for reflected XSS attacks. These attacks
   will not work unless chrome is run with the argument --disable-xss-auditor. 
   
      
 vs2017 branch:
 - Master branch was forked and covered to use with Visual Studio 2017 Community. 
   Nothing much should change but I had to fix a few issues I found while trying to debug the project.
 - Added 'connection.open()' in the sqliteDbProvider class methods. Otherwise, methods were not working.
